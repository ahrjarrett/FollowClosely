## FollowClosely 0.0.1

Partial but working version of the FollowClosely site, which was lost on a Digital Ocean droplet that wasn't backed up.

Homepage works and templates are built, but **routing doesn't seem to work**. Find the Stack Overflow post about how to hack the Ghost core to allow the display of "All Posts" on a route other than the route route.

[Here's the Stack Overflow Link](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23640333/is-there-a-way-to-give-ghost-static-pages-access-to-the-posts-variable-that-in).

#### To Run Dev
1. nvm use 4.2.0
2. npm i
3. `gulp init` (only run once per instance)
4. `gulp ghost`
5. Login at /ghost and choose the FollowClosely 0.0.1 theme
6. Reload

#### To Deploy
Let me get back to you on that.
